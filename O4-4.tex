\begin{abstract}
The SKA is the ultimate software-enabled telescope, given the enormous amounts of computing hardware and software required to perform the data reduction. Systems Engineering is the set of processes and documentation required for managing and successfully realising large-scale engineering projects, but the classical approach is not a good fit for software-intensive projects, especially when the needs of the different stakeholders are not fully known, and requirement priorities might change. In this proceeding we give an overview of the system and software engineering processes in the SKA1 development, and the tension between classical and agile systems engineering, and how that tension helps progressing the design in a stable way, and ultimately leads to the successful construction of the SKA telescopes.

\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an international project with the aim of building multi-purpose radio telescopes, with an equivalent collecting area of at least one square kilometre. It will provide unprecedented sensitivity and survey speed, so that key questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology can be answered. Currently, Phase 1 of the SKA (SKA1) is under design, nearing Critical Design Review (CDR) status.	
	
To give an idea of the problem, data rates between the sensor network elements, and the processing elements of the SKA1 telescopes is shown in the figure below. The amount of processing required by the Central Signal Processor (CSP) is ~50\% of the current most powerful supercomputer in the world\footnote{\url{https://top500.org}}, even if they are simple Multiply-Accumulate operations, and the Science Data Processor (SDP) will require in the order of 2.5 times the capability of the current most powerful computer in the world.
￼	
To design those systems, we have 9 SKA Consortia, whose members cover more than 18 timezones, from Vancouver (GMT-9) to Sydney (GMT+9). Fig. X shows their distribution across the world. The sub-systems being designed by the different consortia are historically called Elements. [REFERENCE TO SPIE]

The SKA Organisation (SKAO) is the design authority, with Integrated Engineering Teams (IETs) per Element with Systems Engineering, Project Management, Operations, and Science considerations always represented. The External IETs include the counterparts from consortia, and we have Telescope Teams which can spawn Resolution Teams when issues need to be discussed and resolved across the whole project.

SKAO retains ownership of the L1 requirements, System Architecture, System Baseline Design, and Functional Analysis, and after CDR we will have ownership of all system and subsystem requirements, and the SE and design artefacts from consortia.

\section{SE principles} % (fold)
\label{sec:se_principles}
Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the full life cycle of successful systems, including problem formulation, solution development and operational sustainment and use. [INCOSE]

During all of those phases, understanding of the system increases, and changes are inevitable. Managing change, and making sure change happens while keeping a working system, is central to SE.
% section se_principles (end)

\section{Agile principles} % (fold)
\label{sec:agile_principles}

From the Agile Manifesto,\footnote{\url{http://agilemanifesto.org}}, its main principles are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	\item Working software over comprehensive documentation
	\item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	\item Responding to change over following a plan	
\end{itemize}

Following those principles, the traditional Software Engineering Management Plan becomes more a framework for the best practices that need to be followed —pull requests between branches/forks versus commits to master, code reviews, Test Driven Design—, and not a final blueprint on how the software will be managed.

It also means that traditional Work-Breakdown-Structure oriented approaches don’t fully work, and that instead, what is finally built is a result of agreements with stakeholders, as we will:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Keep communication with all stakeholders involved in the project, with the conversation being 	
	\item To have continuous integration of the software systems	
	\item To hire software developers (or development entities) that are invested in the system, not merely contracted; but also sharing gains with contractors if something is done faster than expected, or some desirable metrics are exceeded	
	\item To have systems and processes that accommodate software change and still can prove requirements are satisfied; this means not using a document-centric requirements management system, but being able to integrated requirements, development, testing, and results with a quick turnaround.	
\end{itemize}

And all of this is made on a fixed cadence —with the fastest period being the \emph{sprint}—, trying to keep momentum, allowing teams to self-organise their prioritised tasks.

\section{SE and Agile} % (fold)
\label{sec:se_and_agile}
Successfully marrying Agile principles and System Engineering principles means that, instead of making sure the SE processes are correct so that we remove the human factor, and that we can prove that the system, as designed, will behave as intended when built, we focus on delivering a minimum viable system as soon as possible, constructed from minimum viable subsystems, and we keep adding functionality, making sure we keep the intended behaviours that we have already built, and that we incorporate the still not incorporated behaviours as development progresses.	

That means that we need metrics to keep track of the progress towards design completion during the design phase —the downward part of the V—, and then to record validation of the design artefacts —upward part of the V—. But you also want to be able to support those processes even when the design phase does not go through a traditional V, but it is made of multiple, indented Vs. See for instance Figure XXX, that reproduces Fig. 3.9 from the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook, 4th edition [INCOSE].	
￼	
If the killer function of Agile development is Continuous Integration, and be always available to deliver working software, the killer function for Agile Systems Engineering is Continuous Inspection, and be always able to deliver status of compliance, and of progress, almost at any moment, and on cadence.

\section{References}
References must be provided in BibTeX format, in a .bib file, and should usually be referenced using \verb"\citet" or \verb"\citep". The file example.bib supplied with this template is taken from an ADASS 2015 paper, and includes references to previous ADASS proceedings 
\citep[such as][]{1999ASPC..172..487P} and to papers in what was then the current 2015 proceedings (e.g.\ \citet{O11-4_adassxxv}). Note that the `TBD' entries that appear for papers in the current proceedings will be dealt with by the ADASS editors when the final volume is produced. The example .bib file has a large number of references unused by this template file; such unused references have been left in as an example, but should be removed before a paper is submitted.

\acknowledgements The ASP would like to thank the dedicated researchers who are publishing with the ASP.  It will make things a lot easier if you keep this text on the same line as the \verb"\acknowledgements" command.
